# Quotidian - Quote Saver iOS App

## Overview
Quotidian is an iOS application designed for users to collect and save their favorite quotes. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface to store, view, and manage a personal collection of quotes.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Upon opening the app, users are greeted with a list of quotes they have previously saved. Each quote is presented in a card-like format showing the quote text, author, and source if available.

- **Swipe to Delete**: Users can swipe left on a quote to reveal a delete button. Tapping this button will remove the quote from their collection after a confirmation prompt.

- **Add New Quote**: A prominent blue "New" button is located at the top right corner of the home screen. Tapping this button opens a sheet where users can input new quotes. The input fields include:
  - Quote text
  - Author name
  - Source or link (optional)
  - Tags or categories (optional)

- **Persistence**: Quotes are saved locally on the device, ensuring that users can access their collection at any time, even without an internet connection.
